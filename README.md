Hi! I am a software developer in Chicago on an adventure exploring web technology.

You can find me building projects on [codepen](https://codepen.io/sean_codes) and sharing code for tools, plugins, and other experiments here on github.

Along the way I take pictures of my computer and share my story on [instagram](https://instagram.com/sean_codes).

When not writing code I like jumping ramps on my bicycle, playing video games, and hanging out with my cat.

Thanks for visiting! ♥️
